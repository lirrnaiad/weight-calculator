# Weight on Other Planets Calculator

A simple calculator for C++ practice  
I'll improve this one every once in a while  
  
  
## To do:

### **Loop**  
- after results are displayed, ask user if they would like to repeat it again
- 3 options:
  - loop back to weight input
  - loop back to planet selection
  - exit program  
  
  
### **Round Off Weight**
- make demical places consistent to 2, but make whole number unlimited (not really lol)
  - eg. 5416.24kg -- 1.27kg -- 412516.61kg
- cout precision is set to 5, if user inputs weight higher or lesser than usual the decimal places will be reduced to 1 or even none
  - eg. 14.481kg -- 6123.2 -- 12752kg
- cout precision also makes whole number limited to 5 digits, so if the result has more than 5 digits, only 5 digits will be shown
  
  
### **Make Calculations a "do while" Statement**
- switch is too basic and if I ever add more planets in the future it'll be a pain in the ass lol
- would make my code cleaner and have less bloat too
  
  
### **QA Stuff**
- this'll come eventually lol
